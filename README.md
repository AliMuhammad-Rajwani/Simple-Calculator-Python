# Basic Calculator Project 🧮

This is a basic calculator written in Python that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition ➕, subtraction ➖, multiplication ✖️, and division ➗. The program prompts the user to select an operation, takes two numeric inputs, and displays the result. It includes error handling for division by zero 🚫 and invalid inputs ❌, ensuring a smooth user experience. This project demonstrates my understanding of control structures, user input handling, and basic arithmetic in Python. 💻
